# package-tracking

A graphql service which returns package tracking data for a hypothetical package tracking system.  

This purpose of this project was to get more familiar with graphql-clj, so I chose a database schema that I designed and built the graphql service around it.  

For more info about the design, see [the docs](./doc/intro.md).

## Usage

First start up the database:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start up a postgres instance with some test data.

next, run the service:
```
lein ring server
```
